# E-Ticket-Management-System

E-ticket management system can be used to manage all intercity bus services and their counters. It is being developed for the intercity bus company who have a lot of buses/coaches alongwith different counters book ticket of a bus manually. Using E-Ticket management system a bus owner can easily maintain all his buses and counters in a single application. Besides, general users/passengers can search for buses and book tickets. 

Firstly, a bus owner have to be registered by our admin. Then he have to add all his counters. Counter account will be generated automatically with a default password. Then he will add his available buses/coaches with departure time and counter.
Counter owner will have a different panel. He will be responsible for booking tickets assigned to his counter. 
A registered user will be able to search for buses and book his/her ticket from our system.  

This proposed system has four different panels of independent responsibility which are Admin Panel, Owner Panel, Counter Panel & User Panel.
